## üåü About The Project

Welcome to my interactive 3D portfolio! This project is a creative demonstration of modern web development, blending a robust **Angular 17** frontend with the power of **Three.js (WebGL)** for 3D graphics. 

Instead of a traditional resume, I invite you to explore my professional world through a dynamic, stylized night train station scene. The entire environment is procedurally generated, from the station architecture and the moving train to the atmospheric lighting and interactive objects.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Fully Interactive 3D Scene**: Navigate a detailed environment with custom mouse controls (orbit, pan, zoom).
- **Dynamic Content Loading**: Click on interactive signs to load different resume sections (Skills, Projects, etc.).
- **Angular-to-Three.js Bridge**: Angular components are dynamically rendered to a canvas (`html2canvas`) and applied as textures on 3D objects.
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Built with Angular Universal for improved initial load performance and SEO.
- **Detailed Environment**: Features a main station, a train, a bus, animated characters, and multiple light sources to create a rich, immersive atmosphere.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

This project is built with a modern and powerful stack:

- **Frontend**: [Angular](https://angular.io/) v17
