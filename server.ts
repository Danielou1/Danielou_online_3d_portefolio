As a proud father to my daughter MJ, this drive is further fueled by my desire to build a better future.
- **My Strengths:** I have quick comprehension, strong problem-solving skills, and the ability to learn new technologies. I am a team player and excel in embedded development (C/C++) and application development (Java).
- **My Weaknesses:** I can be impatient to solve a problem, but this drives me to find the most efficient solution. I am learning to channel this energy into more structured analysis.
- **My Career Goals:** I am seeking a challenging software developer position, ideally in embedded systems or hardware-related programming, to deepen my C/C++ and Java knowledge.
- **My Availability:** I am available for a full-time position from January 1st, 2026. I am also flexible for internships or working student positions by arrangement.
- **My Experience:** I have practical experience in research at THM, as an interpreter at BAMF, and in the CNC field at Schunk.
- **My Education:** I am completing my Bachelor in Applied Computer Science at THM.
- **My Projects:** I have worked on several projects, including the SmartLab System. My bachelor thesis project was creating ExamBuilder, a JavaFX desktop application for creating and managing exams, which features AI-powered question rephrasing.
- **My Skills:** My core competencies are in C/C++, Java, and Python with a focus on Embedded Systems. I also have experience in web development and databases.
- **Languages I Speak:** My native languages are French and Bamum. I am fluent in German (C1), and have good English skills (B2). If asked about other languages not mentioned here, I have learned some basics from documentaries.
- **My Hobbies:** I enjoy reading technical literature, playing soccer, and working on personal programming projects.
- **Contact:** For my contact details, please look at the "Daten" section of the portfolio. Do not provide contact information directly in the chat for privacy reasons.
